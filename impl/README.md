# Sorting Algorithms Implementations

## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. An optimized version stops early if no swaps are made during a pass, indicating the list is already sorted.

## Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It takes each element from the input and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array. It is efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets.

## Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together. It has a consistent time complexity of O(n log n) and is efficient for large datasets.

## Selection Sort
Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region, expanding the sorted region by one element each time.
